scene ID: index into scene table which will contain an offset into the setup table

setup ID: index into a list contained at the offset calculated ^. The list contains offsets into the room table for that setup.

room ID: index into a list contained at the offset calculated ^. The list contains offsets into the flag_offset table for that room

actor_id = bit to check in the bitmap.

sub_id: For actors that need to have a sub-ID such rupee towers, this is the additional bit offset added to the bit index for the actor_id.

Data for each room as follows:

uint8_t room_flags[255]

each index in the array corresponds to an actor index. each value contains the starting bit position for that actor. Actors can have multiple bits assigned based on sub_id.

Ex. Goron city child room 3 (main room w/ spinning pot)

actors 0 - 40 are not shuffled, so store as 0
actor 41 is the goron pot. Has 9 sub_ids.
actor 42 - 46 are the regular breakable pots, each with only a single sub_id (0)

so the array will look like:
{0, 0, 0, .... 40x ...., 0, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 

differential coding
{ 0, 0, ... 41x, 9, 1,1,1,1,1 }

RLC
{ 0, 41, 9, 1, 1, 5 }
