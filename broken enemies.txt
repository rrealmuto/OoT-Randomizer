Enemies that don't call Item_DropCollectibleRandom at all:
Deku baba (En_Dekubaba) - only calls in certain conditions. When dropping sticks it actually uses get_item instead of dropping an item
Withered deku baba (En_Karebaba)
Hint scrubs: En_hintnuts
Flare Dancer (En_Fd): The main flare dancer actor doesn't drop anything. The core does (en_fw). Core stores a reference to the parent so can probably pass the parent into dropcollectible
Flying floor tile (En_Yukabyun): doesn't normally drop anything?
Nabooru knuckle
Poes
Skullkid (only drops the big rupee).

Other potential issues:
Killing things w/ Light Arrows - Seems to be OK
Like Likes (en_RR) - Actually should be OK
Shellblade (en_sb) - Only call Item_DropCollectibleRandom aif "BodyBreak_SpawnParts returns true. Probably not a problem just a function that keeps getting called when it dies and eventually returns true?
Spike enemy (en_Ny) - Only calls DropCollectibleRandom if unk_1D0 == 0. Which is all the time unless hit by wind arrows so think we're good
Big Octo in Jabu - Spawned by the bg_bdan_objects thing in the room. 
Stalfos in upper forest temple. They get spawned by the falling floor. They do get spawned as children so could hard code them w/ flags to make it work?
Anubis (en_anubice) - Are spawned by en_anubice_tag. Can probably use reference to parent. Parent actor isn't an enemy category though. Maybe just explicitly check for 0x00F6 actor.
Bottom of the well enemies in coffins are spawned by the coffin lids.
Kokiri Forest as Adult - Scene setup coded to change if you've beaten forest temple. 
    Maybe change this if the setting is enabled to always use the setup with the enemies? 
    8009AB08 is the address of the code that sets it to setup 3. instead just use setup 2.
    Write 0x02 to 8009AB0B

Rooms with clear flags if you don't actually get the item from an enemy before clearing the room.
    This can be fixed by writing a hack in the actorspawn function to override the check for the room clear flag. Currently the function does the following:
    If the actor is an enemy and the room clear flag is set, remove the actor's overlay and return null.
    This process starts at 0x8002526C of the actor spawn function.
    actorInit pointer in v1
