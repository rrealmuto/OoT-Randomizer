; I guess try to do this using only temp registers
; Read the entry from the overlay table
; Calculate the RAM address as addr - VRAM Start + File RAM and jump to that address
; Overlay table at 0x800E8530
; when calling, store the address to call in GP and the overlay index in t9
Overlay_Call_Addr:
    li  t0, 0x800E8530 ; current overlay entry
